     Our Mission<img align="right" alt="" src="images/directors.jpg" /></h1>
 <p>The Shohola Scholarship Foundation has a dual mission. We seek to aid boys in making camp a 
 reality each year while building a larger fund whose interest will support future children.
 <br /><br />
Each year, Shohola receives dozens of applications from parents who want to give a summer of
 growth and learning to their children, but cannot afford to do so.
     <br />
     <br />
With your help, we will make the stuff of dreams a reality.</p>
<br /><br />
<h1>Profile</h1>
<p>
The Shohola Scholarship Foundation is a not-for-profit, 501(c)(3), corporation. The money raised 
through your charity goes directly to support tuition for boys at Camp Shohola. The foundation
 pays a deeply discounted tuition for each child, thus assuring that all funds donated benefit
  the child in need.
<br /><br />
The foundation's director is Frank "Kit" Barger, now retired director of Camp Shohola. Now that 
Kit has turned the keys to camp over to his son Duncan, his primary focus, is to share the joy and
 the dream of Camp Shohola with those that may not otherwise be able to attend.
